This is **Project 1** of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. The project is a simple wiki built using Django that converts markdown files into HTML.

## Features

- **Index Page**: Displays a list of all wiki pages. Each page is clickable, leading to the respective wiki content.
- **Markdown to HTML**: The wiki pages are written in markdown and automatically converted to HTML.
- **Create a New Page**: You can add a new page by providing a title and content. If the title already exists, you will receive an error message saying "Title already exists."
- **Edit a Page**: You can edit existing pages and update their content.
- **Random Page**: A button is available to render a random page each time it is clicked.
